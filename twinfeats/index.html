      "TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations.
We will work with you to fully understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web applications are
all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer."

    "Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web application is a web site
    powered by a database. Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies by user and
    can change every single second."
